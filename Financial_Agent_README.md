## Introduction

This project integrates the powerful Groq API and Anthropic's Claude API to build an intelligent **Financial Agent** capable of processing financial data, answering queries, making predictions, and providing insights. The agent can handle tasks such as:

- **Data analysis** for market trends
- **Financial forecasting**
- **Automated portfolio management**
- **Risk assessment** and optimization
- **Natural language interactions** for financial advisory

---

## Features

- **Financial Data Insights**: Process financial statements, balance sheets, and market data.
- **Forecasting**: Use advanced AI models to predict stock prices, economic trends, and more.
- **Conversational Interface**: Users can interact with the agent using natural language to get personalized financial advice.
- **Customizable Model**: Fine-tune Groq and Claude models to fit specific business needs.
- **Risk Management**: Automate financial decision-making processes based on user-defined risk profiles.

## Setup and Installation

To get started, clone this repository and follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tushar-CYL/AI-Agent/financial-agent.git
cd financial-agent
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then install the necessary Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up API Keys
Store your **Groq API key** and **Claude API key** securely. For example, add them to a `.env` file:
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
CLAUDE_API_KEY="your_claude_api_key"
```

Use the `dotenv` library to load the keys into your environment:
```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

In your Python script, load the keys like this:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

groq_api_key = os.getenv('GROQ_API_KEY')
claude_api_key = os.getenv('CLAUDE_API_KEY')
```

### 4. Run the Agent
After setting up, you can run the agent:
```bash
python financial_agent.py
```

## API Integration

### Groq API
Groq provides powerful computing for high-performance financial models. Ensure you have the API key, and use it for various tasks such as data processing, portfolio management, and more.

### Claude API
Claude by Anthropic is responsible for handling natural language queries and conversational interfaces. Use the Claude API for tasks like providing personalized financial advice, answering user queries, or processing document-based requests.

---

## Usage

### Basic Example for Financial Analysis
Here’s how you might use the APIs to perform basic financial analysis:
```python
# Example to fetch data from Groq API and process it
def fetch_financial_data():
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.groq.com/data", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {groq_api_key}"})
    return response.json()

# Use Claude to generate a report or advice based on data
def generate_financial_advice(data):
    response = requests.post(f"https://api.anthropic.com/claude", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {claude_api_key}"}, json={"query": f"Provide financial advice based on this data: {data}"})
    return response.json()
```

### Interactive Mode
To enable interactive financial queries:
```python
# Example for interactive conversation using Claude API
def interactive_advice():
    user_query = input("How can I assist you with your finances today? ")
    response = generate_financial_advice(user_query)
    print("Claude's response:", response)
```

## Diagram

### Diagram of Financial Agent Architecture
Below is a description of the architecture flow you can visualize:

1. **User Input (Query)**  
   The user interacts with the **Conversational Interface**, entering a query like "What’s the current state of my portfolio?"

2. **Claude API (Natural Language Understanding)**  
   Claude processes the user's query, breaking it down into actionable insights and requests to relevant data sources.

3. **Groq API (Data Processing)**  
   The Groq API handles large-scale data processing tasks, fetching financial data such as stock prices, balances, or transaction history.

4. **Decision Engine (Financial Models)**  
   Based on processed data, the decision engine models the financial advice or recommendation using **AI/ML models** fine-tuned for financial predictions.

5. **User Output (Report/Advice)**  
   The system returns a well-structured response to the user, summarizing financial advice or answering a specific query.

---

### Diagram Details

To visualize, consider the following flow:

```plaintext
User Input (Query) → Claude API (Natural Language) → Groq API (Data Fetching)
                                ↓
                      Decision Engine (Analysis)
                                ↓
                      User Output (Financial Advice)
```

You can use tools like **Lucidchart** or **Draw.io** to create a flowchart and integrate the diagram in your repository.
